This is a showcase of my early-day code (late 2010).

**Not intended for use.**

**Will not be maintained in any way.**

Some info
==========

This project is a reimplementation of the previous [migvkscript](https://github.com/mr-mig/showcase-migvkscript) enhancer for [vk.com](http://vk.com)

The initial repo was hosted on [Google Code](https://code.google.com/p/vuzzle/)


What's that anyway?
===================

Basically, this intended to be a platform for enhancement modules.

This take was based on new knowledge gained during my programming level up.

The basic ideas were:
1. Splitting the *migvkscript* into Platform and Modules
2. Split everything in modules with **separated updates lyfecycle and versioning**
3. Adding some internationalization
4. Synchronization between tabs
5. Adding the ability to install 3rd-party code **in runtime**
6. **Using Google Code hosting as an assets server**

Is it working?
==============

I believe the script can be run with slight modifications to adhere to nowadays userscript sandbox.

The development was ceased to to **major vk.com update**. They had made the whole site AJAX-based and rolled out a lot of features from userscripts.
